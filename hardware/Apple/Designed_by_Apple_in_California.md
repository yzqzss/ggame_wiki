## 删除这句话可能与审查有关

> As Mr. Guthrie was delivering his warnings, Apple set about keeping the Chinese government happy. Part of that effort was new research and development centers in China. But those R&D centers complicated Apple’s image as a California company. At a summit for its new Chinese engineers and designers, Apple showed a video that ended with a phrase that Apple had been inscribing on the backs of iPhones for years: “Designed by Apple in California.”
>
> The Chinese employees were angered, according to Mr. Guthrie and another person in the room. If the products were designed in California, they shouted, then what were they doing in China?
>
> “The statement was deeply offensive to them,” said Mr. Guthrie, who left Apple in 2019 to return to his home in Michigan. “They were just furious.”
>
> The next iPhone didn’t include the phrase.[^censorship]

> After Chinese employees complained, it even dropped the “Designed by Apple in California” slogan from the backs of iPhones.[^censorship]

随后苹果在 2017 年停止在 iPhone X 和 iPhone 8 的 iPhone 背面印上这些内容，但无法验证具体的原因。[^nyt_apple_china_icloud]

除了 iPhone，其他的 Apple 设备基本现在仍然保留了「Designed by Apple in California」这句 slogan 。
